# Genetic Algorithm
One of the simple (and vulnerable) algorithms used for encoding texts is the substitution cipher.
This cipher has a very big state space, but can be broken using a dictionary of words and a correct approach. In this assignment, we use the genetic algorithm to decode a text encoded by the substitution cipher. The complete report can be read in the HTML file included in the repository.
