    "### Substitution Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simple (and vulnerable) algorithms used for encoding texts is the substitution cipher. This cypher maps each letter of the alphabet to another letter (creating the 'key' or the 'ciphered alphabet') and substitutes each letter in the original text for its respectively mapped one.\n",
    "The substitution cipher key has a very big state space (as there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, there are $26! \\approx 2^{88}$ possible keys); nevertheless, this cipher is not as secure as it seems. If there is a relatively big database of words (called a dictionary) containing the majority of the words used in the ciphered text, the correctness of a certain key can be measured by using it on the ciphered text and finding meaningful words. As a result, the key can be modified and tested again until the correct key is found.\n",
    "One of the ways of finding the key to a ciphered text (given a dictionary) is using the genetic algorithm, which is explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The genetic algorithm is based on Darwin's theory of evolution and is inspired by the process of natural selection. The process of natural selection starts with the selection of the fittest individuals from a population. They produce offspring which inherit the characteristics of the parents and will be added to the next generation. If parents have a better fitness, their offspring will be better than the parents and have a better chance at surviving. This process keeps on iterating and at the end, a generation with the fittest individuals will be found. The genetic algorithms replicate this process, first creating an initial population (which is created randomly in order to make sure individuals from the whole state space have a chance to be in the population) and then performing the natural selection on the population and it's following generations until a desirable solution is found. In order to be able to rate individuals (the units from which a population is created), a fitness function should be defined which can assign a fitness score to each of them. In addition, the algorithm should have the ability of producing new generations of the population, so crossover and mutation functions are needed. The crossover function is used to generate new offspring from the individuals and the mutation function mutates the offspring (changes them, usually randomly and with a given probability) before being added to the population. Another point to be noticed is the population size which is constant, and for the new offspring to be added to the population, the weakest individuals of the previous generation should be removed.\n",

    "\n",
    "The individuals in this assignment are lists of characters with 26 elements (a ciphered alphabet). Each alphabet letter is used exactly once in each individual and its index in the list, shows the index of the letter from the original alphabet which is mapped to it.\n",
    "As an Example, consider the key __'hijazdwvupqrbcegfmnokltsxy'__, this key shows that the letter 'a' in the encoded text, means the letter 'h' in the original one; 'b' shows 'i' and so on.\n",
